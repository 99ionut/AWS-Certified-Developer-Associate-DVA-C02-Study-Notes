# IAM
### (identity and Access Managment)
Its a global service (doesnt matter in which region i create the user, available everywhere)

Composed of:
- Root account created by default (follow best practices)
- Users
  - can be in groups (can't contain other groups, not all users need a group, a user can be in multiple groups)
  - can be in Organizations

Permissions: a user can be assigned a JSON policy where we tell what they are allowed to do
least privilege best practice.
